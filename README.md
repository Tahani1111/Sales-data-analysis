The profit for Q4 is the highest, at $7,527,235.00, and the sales for Q4 are also the highest, at $51,690,104.00. The profit for Q4 is 15%, which is also the highest for the four quarters.
The average revenue and number of units sold per order is 105 units per order. This means that, on average, each order contains 105 units and generates 105 units of revenue. The analysis showed a gradual increase in the number of units sold per order indicating that customers are buying more units per order, on average. 
From January to December the total number of discounts was $9,205,268, and the highest profit generated was $262,200. The average sales were $169,609. and 228 transaction was above the average sales and 472 transactions were low sales
